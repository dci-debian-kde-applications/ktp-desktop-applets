ktp-desktop-applets (16.04.0-1~1.gbp45bbba) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  ** SNAPSHOT build @45bbbae188e03f0b7c5723882e197581fcd48115 **

  [ Maximiliano Curia ]
  * New upstream release (15.12.2).

  [ George Goldberg ]
  * beginnings of an applet that displays a users online/offline status from the decibel presence dataengine
  * Get the presence applet working again with current plasma API.
  * Remove methods that are no longer needed.
  * Add some colour scheme support to make it look nicer, and start to calculate the master presence state and message.
  * Change the presence applet to use the new PresenceState and values passed, making it compatible with recent dataengine changes.
  * Basic implementation of changing master icon. If one or more accounts are offline, it now displays the offline icon, otherwise the online icon. Needs some serious thought about when to use which icon.
  * Use the kopete method to choose the master presence type. (Thanks Earthwings, for the tip :) ).
  * Show the master presence icon on the main widget, not just the taskbar.
  * Major cleanup to make the code a bit tidier and to match the decibel coding style, since that is where this applet will most likely end up when it moves out of playground. Previously there was no consistent code style, just mess...
  * Add a label for the master presence status to be displayed.
  * Store the master status message even when no widget exists.
  * Use correct key to retrieve status message from engine.
  * Set previousStatusMessage correctly so that it does not always result in there being different status messages.
  * Make status message readable by using appropriate text colour.
  * Stub in a custom delegate to draw each account in the presence view widget.
  * Draw icon in view for the status type of each account.
  * Fix presence applet to compile against latest telepathy-qt4 bindings.
  * Fix to compile with latest tpqt4 API.
  * Remove all tpqt4 stuff from the plasmoid - it should do stuff through the presence dataengine, not directly. It will now display the presence correctly for individual accounts.
  * ebn fixes.
  * Update the data source entry names to match what they now are called in the dataengine.
  * Fix up master presence display and available state icon display.
  * Remove old C++ files ready for a QML port.
